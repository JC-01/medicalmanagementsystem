Preparing your Images

Using CSS to style your images is a common approach. 
However, it is rarely a good idea to use CSS to style the size of your images!! 
Often the height/width ratio of your images becomes skewed. 
Or you end up with neighboring images that don't "right." 
Instead, identify those images that will be grouped together use other editing software 
to get your image sizes consistent. 
You can also create multiple copies of images and use condensed versions on your mobile site to preserve bandwidth.
