WebAIM quick reference

There is no easy (or fully-automated) way to do full accessibility test of your site. 
You can find some tools to help you, but it still takes a human to evaluate many elements. 
The WebAIM Quick Reference is a list of steps that you can take. 
For your portfolio you may want to pick just a few of the many suggestions and implement 
them as one of your advanced options.
