Building your site from a template

Another option for your portfolio is to use a pre-existing template. 
Lets be honest, if you want a webpage there is no reason to create it from 
scratch if there is existing code you can utilize. 
The challenge in using a template will be that you need to make sure that you can 
modify the code to make sure it works for your content AND my requirements 
(the code needs to pass the w3 validator as well as be responsive.) 
If you choose this option you will need to include a small write-up describing the changes 
you made from the original code.

Would you like an example?
Example One:

Template: http://www.templatemo.com/live/templatemo_446_boxer

Modified site: http://winespto.org/

But....look at the errors that would need 
to be fixed: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwinespto.org%2F

Example Two:

Template: http://htmlcoder.me/preview/worthy/v.1.0/

Modified site: http://www.intro-webdesign.com/ (Look familiar?)

In this example there were a lot more structural changes since the template didn't exactly match 
what I was looking for.

If you would like a little more of a refresher, here is a link to a lecture on templates from 
the Responsive Design course:
