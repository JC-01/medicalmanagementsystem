Building your site using a framework

The third option is to use an exiting framework such as Bootstrap. 
This option combines the creative aspects of the scratch option and the structured approach of the template option. 
You do NOT need to use Bootstrap, you can choose any framework that you would like. 
You can find a list of possible alternatives here: http://modernweb.com/2014/02/17/8-bootstrap-alternatives/. 
Of course you are free to utilize other options as well.

I want to let you know that many of my students choose the framework option, 
but struggle getting some of the code to adhere to proper standards. 
In your project you will need to make sure that you adhere to the w3 and wave validators. 
The reason that I am sharing this with you is to help you pick a realistic layout for your work.

Example One:

In this example Bootstrap 3 is used.

The site: http://collemc.people.si.umich.edu/WebDesign.html

Make sure to resize the page to check out the responsive design. 
I have also utilized the Bootstrap carousel. 
There are issues though with validation and accessibility.

What would you do to address these problems?

You can refer to Weeks Three and Four of the Responsive Design course if you would like to review some 
of the things you can do with the Bootstrap framework. 
I only touch on a few of the options though, 
so the official website is a better source: http://getbootstrap.com/

PS

Thinking about using Bootstrap 4 instead of Bootstrap 3? 
That would definitely count as an "extra" for your portfolio.
