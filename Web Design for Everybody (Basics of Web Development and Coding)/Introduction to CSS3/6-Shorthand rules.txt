Shorthand rules
As you have probably picked up by now, I love my Sublime 
It does lots of great things for me, but sometimes it offers suggestions that I didn't really mean to use. 
One common example is that I often unintentionally switch between using background and background-color. 
Does this make a difference?

For the most part no. The background property can take a number of different values. 
Think about the border example we did in the Box Model lecture. 
This code

border: 1px solid black;


is shorthand for

border-width: 1px;
border-color: black;
border-style: solid;


So when I switch back-and-forth between background and background-color 
I am doing the same sort of thing...using the shorthand. 
What other things can go in the background property? 
Here is an example:

background: #00ff00 url("imgs/ocean.jpg") no-repeat fixed center;

This rule sets:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat, and
background-position
