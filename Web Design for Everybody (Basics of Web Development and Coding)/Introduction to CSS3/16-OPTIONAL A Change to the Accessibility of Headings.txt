OPTIONAL: A Change to the Accessibility of Headings

It used to be that the general rule was one <h1> heading per page. 
However, with the advent of HTML5 and its many container elements (aside, section, article, etc.) 
this rule has changed. Here is a link to an interesting article that explains why multiple <h1> headings 
will probably improve the accessibility and search engine optimization of your page.

But just to be difficult, I will include this link to someone who disagrees.
